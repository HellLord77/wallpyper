                A value of MiracastTransmitterAuthorizationStatus.Blocked causes incoming connections from the specified Transmitter to be automatically rejected without prompting the user.*

                    *When the value is MiracastTransmitterAuthorizationStatus.Allowed, the effective MiracastReceiverAuthorizationMethod value becomes MiracastReceiverAuthorizationMethod.None, i.e., the user is not prompted and no PIN is displayed.*

                    *When the value is MiracastTransmitterAuthorizationStatus.AlwaysPrompt, the effective MiracastReceiverAuthorizationMethod value becomes MiracastReceiverAuthorizationMethod.ConfirmConnection, i.e., the user is prompted even if a PIN authorization is requested.*

                    *MiracastReceiverSettings.RequireAuthorizationFromKnownTransmitters overrides the above if the value has been set to true.
                In that case, values of MiracastTransmitterAuthorizationStatus.Allowed and MiracastTransmitterAuthorizationStatus.AlwaysPrompt are treated the same way as the value MiracastTransmitterAuthorizationStatus.Undecided, which means that the MiracastReceiverAuthorizationMethod value controls the authorization method.*

            **Remarks:**
                *The HostNameSortOptions enumeration affects how a list of EndpointPair objects are sorted.*

                *Given an array of sorted address pairs, the None value returns a sorted list ordering the EndpointPair entries such that pairs with least tried source and destination addresses are prioritized over pairs whose addresses have been tried before and were unsuccessful. The goal is to minimize the connection establishment delay by trying EndpointPair entries with unique addresses first. This might result in less efficient address pairs to be preferred over efficient ones when considering network transfer speeds for long running connections, but that is considered less important than minimizing connection delays for short connections.*

                *For example, if EndpointPair objects can have source addresses of S1 or S2 and destination addresses of D1 or D2, then by default if S1+D1 is the first EndpointPair tried and the connection fails, then S2+D2 is the second pair that would be tried. If the S1+D1 connection fails, the problem might be with either S1 or D1. So the safest option to minimize connection establishment delays would be to try S2+D2 when S1+D1 fails. For activities such as web browsing where speed of getting a connection established dominates, that is most likely the behavior you want.*

                *However if the application is streaming media for a long time, you might be willing to accept a few initial failed connection attempts until you find a more efficient path for transferring data. That would use a different order for sorting. The OptimizeForLongConnections enumeration value would be used for this case. With this setting if S1+D1 fails, then S1+D2 or S2+D1 would be tried next.*

                **Remarks:**
                    *The Role property is used in multi-peer app connections to identify whether the peer app is the Host or Client, or if the peer app is participating in a two-peer connection as a Peer. For multi-peer app connections, you must set the Role property before calling the Start method. If the Role property is not set, the default is Peer.*

                    *In a multi-peer app scenario, the Role identifies the capability of the apps to connect. A Host app can connect to up to four Client apps. Host apps can only discover apps that advertise as Client apps. Client apps can only discover apps that advertise as Host apps. The Peer role identifies a two-app scenario. Therefore, Peer apps can only discover other Peer apps. The same rules apply for peer apps connected using a tap gesture. For example, apps advertising as Host apps can only tap to connect with apps advertising as Client apps.*

                    *The SocketProtectionLevel enumeration allow clients to control protocol negotiation for security options with servers when using the StreamSocket object.*

                    *For TCP sockets, the various enum values allow app developers to control the use of the TLS 1.2, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.0, and SSL 3.0 protocols and restrict the use of the RC4 and other weak ciphers which are considered insecure. This allows developers to configure apps that are compatible across a very wide set of servers.*

                    *For Bluetooth RFCOMM sockets, the various enum values allow app developers to control the use of Bluetooth encryption.*

                    *The users of non-domain joined machines can also disable ciphers and protocols by using registry settings. For more information, see How to Restrict the Use of Certain Cryptographic Algorithms and Protocols in Schannel.dll.*

                    *The SocketProtectionLevel enumeration also allow servers to control protocol negotiation for security with clients when using the StreamSocketListener object to listen and bind to sockets over Bluetooth. When the StreamSocketListener object is used over Bluetooth, the supported SocketProtectionLevel values are PlainSocket, BluetoothEncryptionAllowNullAuthentication, or BluetoothEncryptionWithAuthentication. When the StreamSocketListener object is used to listen and bind to TCP sockets, the only supported SocketProtectionLevel value is PlainSocket.*

                    *The SocketSslErrorSeverity enumeration indicates the category of error that occurs when an SSL connection to a server is established.*

                    *SSL server errors should only be ignored in advanced scenarios. Disregarding server certificate errors classified as either Ignorable or Fatal may result in the loss of privacy or integrity of the content passed over the SSL session.*

                    *Some organizations may use self-signed certificates for private use rather than registered the certificates with a trusted certificate authority. An SSL connection to these sites might be a case where an Ignorable error might be tolerated if the server's SSL certificate can be verified by other means.*

                    *To validate self-signed certificates effectively, an app must validate the public key of the certificate (using a certificate thumbprint or hash of the public key, for example). See the Windows.Security.Cryptography.Certificates namespace for classes that support calculating certificate thumbprints and other validation operations.*

                    *If the public key cannot be validated, displaying other certificate details to users by default is not advisable. This may cause users to assume the information is valid when it may in fact be provided by an attacker.*

                **Remarks:**
                    *ValidationRequired and StreamingAllowed are mutually exclusive fields.*

                    *ValidationRequired offers two guarantees to a sync provider. First, it guarantees that the data returned by the sync provider is always persisted to the disk prior to it being returned to the user application; second, it allows the sync provider to retrieve the same data it has returned previously to the platform and validate its integrity. Only upon a successful confirmation of the integrity by the sync provider will the platform complete the user IO request. This modifier helps support end-to-end data integrity at the cost of extra disk IOs.*

                    *StreamingAllowed grants the platform the permission to not store any data returned by a sync provider on local disks. This policy modifier is mutually exclusive with ValidationRequired. The API fails with ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER when both flags are specified.*

                    *AutoDehydrationAllowed grants the platform the permission to dehydrate in-sync cloud file placeholders without the help of sync providers. Without this flag, the platform is not allowed to call CfDehydratePlaceholder directly. Instead, the only supported way to dehydrate a cloud file placeholder is to clear the file’s pinned attribute and set the file’s unpinned attribute and then the actual dehydration will be performed asynchronously by the sync engine after it receives the directory change notification on the two attributes. When this flag is specified, the platform will be allowed to invoke CfDehydratePlaceholder directly on any in-sync cloud file placeholder. It is recommended for sync providers to support auto dehydration.*

                    *A user can turn on battery saver at any time to save energy (as long as the device is running on battery power). Battery saver extends battery life by limiting background activity on the device. In addition to the efforts of battery saver, your app can do its own part to save energy. Before initiating resource intensive tasks, check EnergySaverStatus to make sure battery saver isn’t on. If your app’s resource intensive tasks are long-running, listen for the EnergySaverStatusChanged event so that those tasks can be stopped when battery saver is turned on.*

                    *A user can also set battery saver to turn on automatically when the battery reaches a specified charge threshold, such as 20% remaining. When it's in this state (before it turns on automatically), EnergySaverStatus is Off. If the user disables this automatic setting, EnergySaverStatus is Disabled.*

                    *Even if the automatic setting is enabled, when the device is plugged in, battery saver is turned off and EnergySaverStatus is Disabled. It is not Off because as long as the device is plugged in, battery saver cannot be turned on.*

                    *When battery saver is on, the receipt of push notifications is disabled to save energy. But there are a couple exceptions to this. Battery saver settings (from the Settings app) provides settings that allow your app to receive push notifications even when battery saver is on. If your app depends heavily on push notifications, we recommend notifying users that they may not receive notifications while battery saver is on and to make it easy for them to adjust battery saver settings. For more info and examples, see Windows Push Notification Services (WNS) overview.*

                        Defines constants that specify how panning snap points are processed for gesture/manipulation input.


                    **Remarks:**
                        *For panning actions, there are often natural stopping places. Snap points provide a way to indicate where these places are. Then, when a user swipes, the manipulation result favors that natural point using behavior as expressed by a SnapPointsType value. The proximity determination is made by the Direct Manipulation subsystem that supports the manipulation handling for a XAML ScrollViewer. The Single variations factor in both the inertia and the release point.*

                        *Proximity points (Optional and OptionalSingle):
                     When a user is going to naturally stop the manipulation in the proximity of a snap point, proximity points help the user land at the natural stopping place. Because the user has to land in proximity to the snap point to cause it to stop there, the user will sometimes have to perform another swipe to reach a snap point.*

                        *Mandatory snap points (Mandatory and MandatorySingle):
                     In contrast to proximity, mandatory snap points ensure that the content is adjusted to always land on a snap point. Even if the user releases the manipulation halfway between two snap-points, it will always move to one of the snap points.*

                        *The SnapPointsType enumeration is used as a value for the ScrollViewer.HorizontalSnapPointsType and ScrollViewer.VerticalSnapPointsType properties.*

                        *To see the effects of snap points on ScrollViewer behavior yourself, get the XAML scrolling, panning and zooming sample. Run the sample on a touch device (not the simulator). Try out the SnapPointsType values when you view the "Panning with snap-points" example page of the sample.*

                        *During print preview, call SetPreviewPageCount with the value PreviewPageCountType.Intermediate. This way, the print preview can show the first page while the app calculates the rest of the pages. If the actual page count to be printed is known, pass PreviewPageCountType.Final. When PreviewPageCountType.Final is passed to SetPreviewPageCount, SetJobPageCount method is called with the total number of pages.*
